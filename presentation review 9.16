#App - 
Increase the desktop functionality to a final prodcut
> stretch goal - admin, testing, map view for where sessions are located around the city
Treat your mobile features to a minimum and showcase 1-2 of them during the presentation

#Presentation - 
Did really great
If you focus on your web app and have your phone loaded up ready to go, you might not speed through your app
Talking through the life cycle of a session is a whole lot easier for gauging pace
Don't shift your weight, stand centered
Dress nice ;)

#Mobile - 
Weakest component becasue of unfamiliar territory, showcase it later on in the presentation as a adding bonus feature
I really enjoyed your add a session page and your landing page, 
> stretch goal - include map location, even think about how to invite friends to sessions
  
#My suggestions of weekend action items - 
Complete CRUD of desktop app, works like a gem!
Complete Styling of desktop app
Be able to add a session from mobile
> streth goal - incorporate map view on the mobile version so that you can toggle between days and see sessions happening at those times
